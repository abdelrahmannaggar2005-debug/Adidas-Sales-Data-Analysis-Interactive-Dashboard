# Adidas-Sales-Data-Analysis-Interactive-Dashboard

Project Overview
I built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Adidas sales data from 2020–2021 across multiple retailers, regions, and product categories. Key metrics include total sales ($900M), operating profit ($332M), 2M units sold, average price ($45), and 42% margin. Visuals show monthly sales trends, regional distribution (West 30%, Northeast 20.7%), top products (Men's Street Footwear $209M), and retailer performance. Slicers for region, date, and retailer enable dynamic exploration for strategic insights.
