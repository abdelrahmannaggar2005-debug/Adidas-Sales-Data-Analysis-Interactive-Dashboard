## 🧹 Data Preparation

Before visualization, the dataset was:

1. Loaded and inspected for consistency (dates, formatting, nulls).
2. Transformed in Power Query:   
   - Standardized date and text formats  
   - Extracted time features (Year, Month)  
   - Created calculated columns (e.g., Profit Margin, Unit Revenue)
3. Ensured clean aggregations and eliminated duplicates or missing values.

These steps ensure accurate and consistent results in the dashboard.
